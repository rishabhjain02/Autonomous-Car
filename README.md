In this project, we build a self-driving RC (Remote Controlled) car using Raspberry Pi, Arduino and open source software. Raspberry Pi collects inputs from a camera module and an ultrasonic sensor, and sends data to a computer with wireless connection. The computer processes input images and sensor data for object detection (stop sign) and collision avoidance respectively. A neural network model runs on computer and makes predictions for steering based on input images. Predictions are then sent to the Arduino for RC car control.
